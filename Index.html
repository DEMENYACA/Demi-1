        <h1>Onion Man</h1>
        <h2>So Strong he makes his <em>Enemies</em> Cry</h2>
        <h3> Onions don't bloom they sprout</h3>
        
        <p>I have roamed these streets for over a trillion years bringing tears to his enemies. Types of onions are Georgia Sweet, Sweet Red, TExas Super Sweet, Texas Sweet White, Yellow Granex aka Vidalia
                White Granex and White Bermuda, Walla Walla Sweet, White Sweet Spanish and Yellow Sweet Spanish.  I have seen alot of...I've learned that th
                ere are a lot of layers to crime. 
               Life is an Onion: you peel it year by year and sometimes you cry.
               Like the layers of my skin under the first lie is another and under that anotherand they all make you Cry 
               True friends chop the onions and cry together. Life has many onions. 
             “I'm like an onion. You can peel away my layers, but the further you go, the more it'll make you cry. 
             “Its an onion tree. Every time Sam takes off an onion, two more will grow in its place. 
             Writers are like onions, layers upon layers upon layers.”
             Googles are no good. They can't stop me. My favorite thing to see is when people chop onions then rub their eyes immediately after.
             to me they asks for that" </P>
